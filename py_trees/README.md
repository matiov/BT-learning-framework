# Overview

This module is taken from [splintered-reality/py_trees](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees), with some modifications on the [display function](./py_trees/display.py).

Test routines are just demo templates to easily define and display a Behavior Tree in the `py_trees` fashion.
