# Learning methods for Behavior Trees

In this package the following methods for autonomous generations of Behavior Trees are implemented:
* [Genetic Programming](./bt_learning/gp) (GP);
* [Learning from Demonstration](./bt_learning/learning_from_demo) (LfD);
* [Autonomous Planning](./bt_learning/planner).

* The GP method is also implemented in [*Learning behavior trees with genetic programming in unpredictable environments*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9562088/) with code in [this repository](https://github.com/matiov/learn-BTs-with-GP).
* The GP method is combined with autonomous planning in [*Combining planning and learning of behavior trees for robotic assembly*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09036) with code in [this repository](https://github.com/jstyrud/planning-and-learning)
* The LfD method is implemented in [*Combining Context Awareness and Planning to Learn Behavior Trees from Demonstration*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07133) with code in (TODO: add repo link).
